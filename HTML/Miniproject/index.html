            <p>Chocolate cake is made with chocolate. It can also include 
                other ingredients.[1] These include fudge, vanilla creme,
                and other sweeteners. The history of chocolate cake goes 
                back to the 17th century, when cocoa powder from the
                Americas were added to traditional cake recipes.
                In 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed
                a mechanical extraction method for extracting the fat 
                from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and 
                the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids 
                 that could be sold as it was "rock cacao" or ground into 
                powder.
